# History 

Headquartered in Rancho Margarita, California, the organization has more than 364,000 members in 16,200 clubs in 145 countries. Since it was founded by Ralph Smedley in 1924, TI has helped people of all backgrounds become more confident in front of an audience. 

The first TM club in the Philippines was established in 1935 but *Tamarraw Club* was the first club to be incorporated in 1953. It is also the first TM Club in Asia. *Sultan TMC* was established in April, 1981.

# Flexible Structure

* TMI meetings are expected to last 1-2 hours, with most lasting 1-1.5 hours. 
* Prospects and new members appreciate the minimal time commitment.
* the core meeting can be table topics, prepared speeches and evaluations
* we can have a pre-meeting (like a front act band) with the word of the day and the light moments
* we can have a post-meeting (like a business meeting) with lateral evaluations, planning, socials

  Becker et al, in 2023, discussed ways in which AI tools can  help students learn programming:

1. **AI-generated solutions** can provide students with model answers to programming exercises
2. AI can generate **explanations of complex code**
3. Educators can leave low-level code to A.I. then **shift the focus to algorithms** 
4. AI-generated starter code can help students **combat programmer's writer's block**

# VPL Setup and Use

1. **_Install VPL plugin_** - Installing Moodle VPL is a straightforward process that involves uploading the plugin package and configuring the settings.

2. **_Setup VPL Jail Server_** - Involves setting up a dedicated server, installing the necessary packages, configuring the server, and testing the installation.

3. **_Create VPL Assignments_** - Creating VPL assignments involves careful planning, designing, and testing to ensure they align with learning objectives and effectively assess programming skills.

---

## VPL Plugin

![bg right:70%](img-members/vpl-plugin.png)

* Program in the browser.
* Run tests to grade the programs.
* Check for file similarity.
* Restrict copy-pasting.

# Getting VPL-Jail-System

![bg right:15%](img-members/bg.png)


1. Enter your server 
    * install Visual Studio Code and use the terminal there Open VSCode and press Ctrl-` (i.e. control backtick) 
    * `ssh root@<your-server-ip>`
2. Download the system:
 `wget https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/releases/vpl-jail-system-4.0.2.tar.gz`
3. Unzip the installer:
  `tar xvf vpl-jail-system-4.0.2.tar.gz`

# Tips for installing for the first time: 

* say yes to **LetsEncrypt**  
* put in your **email** when asked for
* type in the given **fully qualified domain name** when asked for (e.g. from Linode)
* say **no** to Kotlin   
* say **no** to JGrasp  
* then make sure to **accept the connections to VPL** when the browser directs you to
> also go to the Local Execution Server, type a space in the box and then hit save.

# If not using cron, run the following every 1 to 2 months

 ```
systemctl status vpl-jail-system.service
systemctl restart vpl-jail-system.service

cd ~
cd vpl-jail-system-4.0.2
./install-vpl-sh full noninteractive start
```

- This will renew your Let's Encrypt SSL certificate
- You can run the code sooner if notice any problems with the VPL Jail Server
- Prepare to wait a bit, but the terminal should show you how things are going.

# What it means:
# -
## `./install-vpl-sh full noninteractive start`
# -

- **full** means to install all the languages it fully supports
- **noninteractive** means to NOT ask you to do anything
- **start** means to start the server once the installation is finished

# Automating daily VPL service restart

* To set up a cron job to restart a service every day on Ubuntu 20.04
    ` crontab -e`
* In the crontab file, to restart the service every day at 3:00 AM, you can use:


* `0 3 * * * systemctl restart vpl-jail-system.service `

*  When setting up cron jobs, it's important to ensure that the user has the **right permissions** (e.g. root) to restart the service.

# Automatically restart the server weekly

- The VPL jail server service will automatically run when after the server restarts

- To automatically restart the server every week in Ubuntu 20.04, you can set up a **cron** job to schedule the restart.

    ` crontab -e`
- In the crontab file, add the following line to schedule the server restart every week:
    `0 0 * * 0 reboot`

# Automatically reinstall the VPL jail system monthly

- To automatically reinstall the VPL jail system from the installer every month in Ubuntu 20.04, you can set up a **cron** job to schedule the reinstall.

    ` crontab -e`

- In the crontab file, add the following line to schedule the system reinstall on the first day of every month:

```
0 0 1 * * cd ~; cd vpl-jail-system-4.0.2; ./install-vpl-sh full noninteractive start
