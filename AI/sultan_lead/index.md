## Lyrics 

[verse]
In unity we thrive, under Sultan's reign,
A beacon of hope, erasing every pain.

So raise your voices, let them ring,
In praise of Sultan, our leader and king.
With virtues unmatched, in heart and hand,
Forever we'll cherish our Sultan's grand stand.


[chorus]
In the land of Sultan, brave and true,
A leader strong, for me and you.
Guiding with wisdom, shining bright,
In the darkest hour, a guiding light.

[verse]
Heroic deeds, for all to see,
Sultan's courage sets us free.
Leading with honor, noble and grand,
Protecting our people, across the land.

Through trials and triumphs, Sultan stands tall,
Inspiring us all, answering the call.

[chorus]
In the land of Sultan, brave and true,
A leader strong, for me and you.
Guiding with wisdom, shining bright,
In the darkest hour, a guiding light.
