# Talk Description

In this talk, we explore three crucial lessons derived from Smedley's approach: the importance of a reliable structure for members, the value of imparting skills and knowledge for member success, and the creation of a safe environment within Sultan Toastmasters for skill enhancement. 

Embracing Smedley's ideals while preserving Sultan traditions of excellence and camaraderie is paramount in fostering a supportive and growth-oriented environment for members.

  Becker et al, in 2023, discussed ways in which AI tools can  help students learn programming:

1. **AI-generated solutions** can provide students with model answers to programming exercises
2. AI can generate **explanations of complex code**
3. Educators can leave low-level code to A.I. then **shift the focus to algorithms** 
4. AI-generated starter code can help students **combat programmer's writer's block**

# VPL Setup and Use

1. **_Install VPL plugin_** - Installing Moodle VPL is a straightforward process that involves uploading the plugin package and configuring the settings.

2. **_Setup VPL Jail Server_** - Involves setting up a dedicated server, installing the necessary packages, configuring the server, and testing the installation.

3. **_Create VPL Assignments_** - Creating VPL assignments involves careful planning, designing, and testing to ensure they align with learning objectives and effectively assess programming skills.

---

## VPL Plugin

![bg right:70%](img/vpl-plugin.png)

* Program in the browser.
* Run tests to grade the programs.
* Check for file similarity.
* Restrict copy-pasting.

# Getting VPL-Jail-System

![bg right:15%](img/bg.png)


1. Enter your server 
    * install Visual Studio Code and use the terminal there Open VSCode and press Ctrl-` (i.e. control backtick) 
    * `ssh root@<your-server-ip>`
2. Download the system:
 `wget https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/releases/vpl-jail-system-4.0.2.tar.gz`
3. Unzip the installer:
  `tar xvf vpl-jail-system-4.0.2.tar.gz`

# Tips for installing for the first time: 

* say yes to **LetsEncrypt**  
* put in your **email** when asked for
* type in the given **fully qualified domain name** when asked for (e.g. from Linode)
* say **no** to Kotlin   
* say **no** to JGrasp  
* then make sure to **accept the connections to VPL** when the browser directs you to
> also go to the Local Execution Server, type a space in the box and then hit save.

# If not using cron, run the following every 1 to 2 months

 ```
systemctl status vpl-jail-system.service
systemctl restart vpl-jail-system.service

cd ~
cd vpl-jail-system-4.0.2
./install-vpl-sh full noninteractive start
```

- This will renew your Let's Encrypt SSL certificate
- You can run the code sooner if notice any problems with the VPL Jail Server
- Prepare to wait a bit, but the terminal should show you how things are going.

# What it means:
# -
## `./install-vpl-sh full noninteractive start`
# -

- **full** means to install all the languages it fully supports
- **noninteractive** means to NOT ask you to do anything
- **start** means to start the server once the installation is finished

# Automating daily VPL service restart

* To set up a cron job to restart a service every day on Ubuntu 20.04
    ` crontab -e`
* In the crontab file, to restart the service every day at 3:00 AM, you can use:


* `0 3 * * * systemctl restart vpl-jail-system.service `

*  When setting up cron jobs, it's important to ensure that the user has the **right permissions** (e.g. root) to restart the service.

# Automatically restart the server weekly

- The VPL jail server service will automatically run when after the server restarts

- To automatically restart the server every week in Ubuntu 20.04, you can set up a **cron** job to schedule the restart.

    ` crontab -e`
- In the crontab file, add the following line to schedule the server restart every week:
    `0 0 * * 0 reboot`

# Automatically reinstall the VPL jail system monthly

- To automatically reinstall the VPL jail system from the installer every month in Ubuntu 20.04, you can set up a **cron** job to schedule the reinstall.

    ` crontab -e`

- In the crontab file, add the following line to schedule the system reinstall on the first day of every month:

```
0 0 1 * * cd ~; cd vpl-jail-system-4.0.2; ./install-vpl-sh full noninteractive start
```

> no need to do any manual commands at this point

# Add the server address to your list of VPL Execution servers

* We simply use the IP address 

```
