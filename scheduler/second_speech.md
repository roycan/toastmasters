## Subject: Request for Speech Evaluation - DL 1 Pathway

Dear Ma'am Menchie,

I hope this message finds you well. I would like to kindly request your evaluation of the speech I will deliver on July 9. Your feedback is invaluable to me as I aim to progress along the DL 1 pathway.

Below, you will find the links to the evaluation form and the presentation slides for your convenience:

Thank you very much for your time and assistance. Your insights and guidance are greatly appreciated.

Warm regards,

Roy
